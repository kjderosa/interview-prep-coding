### so.. what should I do?
- /u/RunninADorito's [Here's How to Prepare for Tech Interviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jov24/heres_how_to_prepare_for_tech_interviews/)

#### data structures:
- **array**              python documentation for [arrays](https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html)
- **linkedlist**         John Shiver's [Implementing a singly linked list in Python](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/implementing-a-singly-linked-list-in-python)
- **queue**              python documentation for [collections.deque](https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/collections.html#collections.deque)
- **trees**              
    - **binary trees**   ddr's response on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2598437/how-to-implement-a-binary-tree-in-python), plus an implementation of delete and repr from [algolist](http://www.algolist.net/Data_structures/Binary_search_tree/Removal)

#### errors and notes along the way

- **pycharm github 403 when trying to push,** followed temlrbek's [response](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/github-https-push-403-error)
- **one underline in Python methods? Python doesn't have real private methods, so one underline at the start of a method indicates that it should be accessible,** from Akshay's response on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8689964/python-why-do-some-functions-have-underscores-before-and-after-the-functio)
